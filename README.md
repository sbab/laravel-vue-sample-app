# Laravel / Vue.js sample app

A small application built with (you should know by now), Laravel and Vue.js.

As of today, nothing is working since I'm still getting my feet wet in this specific stack.

In its final form, this app will handle:
- User registration, login, and profile editing
- Users with admin priviledges (such as editing and deleting other user profiles)
- Role based access control

## Prerequisites
- Laravel Herd with NGINX, PHP 8.3 and Node 22.5.1 installed
